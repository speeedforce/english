Today children's growing process had changed to compare with previous years.
Our kids have born at an information overloading world which's influences their skills, characters, and views of life.
A lot of activities which weren't available before now is a routine for us. The changing rules and give a chance for young people 
to be a part of society is a heavy question for all members which relates to this: governments, parents, and teenagers.
I partly agree with the point that we need to adapt to new challenges and continue to do the best for the next generation, but 
we must save protection to them. In this paper, I'm sharing the two opposite points.

As I mentioned, the process of growing is complicated for parents and children. As we knew, that for a major family in our world
it isn't predictable and no one father or mother can't easily accept that their child has become an independent person.
Therefore they are scared about how their kids would live in the real world, so they protect via restriction them too much.
And it is harmful to their own kids, freeze their self-development and a natural growing way. Parents put them in a warm bath and
after that, young people can't be responsible and ability to make their own decisions. That's why we need to thinks about how we can help modern kids. 
Moreover, several countries changed their attitude yet. They had been shifted the age of getting a passport to the bottom range.
This example emphasizes that governments seriously understand that teenagers have had the ability 
to make their own way. So, if we give them the main official document, why we can give them other benefits as adult people in some parts of life?

However, we should provide society considers the consequences of implementing these rules. The choice of which spheres are dangerous for growing up should 
be the main theme. That's why we need to build a dialog between parents, goverтments, psyсhological scientists. 
The world gives the widest opportunity, but the same way, sometimes it is a heartless, unjustice. For people between 12-18 it might be
more stressfully. Finally, in spite of the all abilities to change the world at so young ages, they have still been the children. They are 
influenced by other people. Our environment builds us and parents shouldn't forget about their responsibility to kids.
They need our maintenance, advice, and of course love. 

In conclusion, I would say that the laws have to consider the new trends because it's a necessity for evolution. But we need to save the base of family,
the fundamentals relationships between adult people and young. Our mission, as for me, to give them all the best as possible.
