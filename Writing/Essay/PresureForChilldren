Today children's growing process has changed in comparison with previous years.
Our kids are born in an information overload world which influences their skills, characters and views of life.
That's why we should adapt to these changes and find ways for ensuring that's our laws are being for our times.

Growing up is a complicated process for parents and children. As we know, that for the majority of families in our world
is a period of challenges. Kids are looking for their place in the world, desire to be independent. Usually, some activities 
can be dangerous to them. That's why parents worried and try to protect them via restriction them too much. 
For teenagers, limitations of their life is an interfering in their life, it entails to conflicts. 
Hence, we need to thinks about how we can help modern kids and parents. 
Moreover, several countries have already changed their attitude yet. They shifted from rm 16 to 14 the age of getting a passport.
This example emphasizes that governments seriously understand that teenagers have the ability to make their own way.

However, we should properly consider the consequences of implementing new laws for young people. 
The world gives the widest opportunity, but sometimes it is a heartless, unjust. For people between 12-18 it might be
more stressful. Finally, in spite of the all abilities to change the world at so young ages, they are still the children. They are 
influenced by other people. That's why the choice of spheres which are dangerous for growing up should be the main theme.

In conclusion, I would say that society has to consider new growing trends. We have all instruments
to give the best opportunities for maintaining and supporting our kids. At the same time, we can keep the protection
for them. Changing the laws is the first step for the next part of evolutions.
