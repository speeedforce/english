The modern world is changing quickly and it influences all spheres of our life. Car's industry isn't an exception and
nowadays we distribute and purchase a lot of vehicles. Traffic is constantly growing and governments try to adapt
driver rules to the new reality. Rechecking knowledge of driving rules in time is a complicated
question and needs particular attention from all of the traffic participants.

We know cases when people get the driver's license before then they purchase a car. The time period between passing 
exams to driving can be really long. Hence, it is possible that a person hasn't got enough practice. In this case, the regular driving 
test can help to fresh the knowledge. The same idea can be useful if a person has a car, but he doesn't have a necessity to drive while a long time.
Regular driving tests can be helpful for beginners. For example, in Ukraine all new drivers 
get a temporary license and should pass the exam again after two years since the first exam. 

However, not all happy with this point. I think all people are different and for someone, this exam can be stressful. To my mind, it relates for a highly responsible people. 
They study properly, but at the same time, they feel pressure on  exams or tests. 
Also, this idea can be annoying for experienced drivers. They spend a lot of time in the car. For someone, it can be the job, 
but the politicians ask them to waste time on the routine thing. 
In conclusion, the changing process for passing driver's tests is a good idea for me, all knowledge needs maintaining. 
However, this process shoud be properly integrated for all type of drivers. The politicians should worry about plenty of conditions
for people who need to repeat these tests, find the way where advantages will clearly for all.
