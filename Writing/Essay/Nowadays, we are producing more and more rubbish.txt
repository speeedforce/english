Nowadays, we are producing more and more rubbish.
Why do you think this is happening?
What can government do to help reduce the amount of rubbish produced?

1) overpopulation
2) plastics cheaper than ecological material

3) Deliver information about sorting garbage
3.1) Building recycling plants
3.2) Avoid and decrease using 

The current world has a lot of ecological problems: global warming, poisoning water, and garbage.
With overpopulation, we need to produce many things. The majority of them are made from plastic or 
other dangerous substance for our nature.

The people population is growing and the people need much staff for their living. Making all staff
from ecological materials is expensive. So, that's why we use plastic
everywhere. Fortunately, ecological activists emphasize this problem, and the government has been becoming to do the right things.

First of all, people should be informed about the dangers of not a natural material and their influence on our
environment. The government should be more proactive in sharing this knowledge with other people. Exist on rubbish sorting process, change plastic packages to ceramic, etc. Not only words will help, but also they need
to pay attention to developing a recycling plant. As I know, some developed countries like Norway, Swedish have
already used these plants for producing energy.

In conclusion, this issue important for our future. People and politics should work together for combating it.
On the one hand, people should be more responsible for their consumption and think about the future, 
on the other hand, politions should avoid populism and continue working on it.
