The problem

What he should do


    Dr. Mr. Evans, my name is Stanislav. I am deeply concerned about the noises in the nearest flat.
    I rent your apartment on Google street 3, number 4. I am satisfied with all 
accommodation there and its convenient location  for me. But the last several weeks, 
I've been struggling with the noises of my new neighbors. 
    They listen to music so loud and usually at night. Sometimes they make parties 
with many people which restricted by rent rules. Their behavior influences on my health 
and I've got a problem with sleep. I tried to talk with them, but they didn't accept my arguments.
    That is why, I insist that you should give them a warning of their behavior. 
If they don't follow the common rules, I will ask you to evict them.
    Sincerely, Stanislav Zinoviev.
