Dr. Mr. Pitter.
    My name is Stanislav Zinoviev, I am a software engineear in claud unit.
    Last year team and I were working on merging two parts of source code and increasing performance.
    My responsibilities were maintaining the old part and making a smooth merging between 
a new one. At the finishing of the year, we have got final results of tests.
All our expectations were approved. The allocations of code were decreased by 11 percent, also we've already had
a one storage of code. It is very a useful improvement for next development.
   Hence, I am interested in increasing my knowledge in performance testing, that is why I want to ask approvement for promotion 
to new training course which our company provides. Thanks for your attention.
    Yours sincerely, Stas Zinoviev.
