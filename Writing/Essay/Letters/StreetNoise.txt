Dear Sir or Madam,
I am writing this letter to report the noises near my apartment due to road-working at the illegal working time.

My name is Stanislav Zinoviev and I live in 3 Google street, house number 4 over 5 years. 

The local road department has been working on the repairing street for three weeks. 
The works are very loud and it wasn't a problem until the schedule was acceptable by law. 
In the first week, they were doing their job between 10 AM from 18 PM and people ussually at work at this time.
But, then time frame of work has become 9 AM from 22 PM and it is unacceptable. By local law the loud sounds restricted
befor 10 AM and after 18 PM.

I am deeply distressed by this situation because I am getting issues with my daily rest time from the repairing.
I came to know that many people have reported the same problem to the council, and it is being investigated by
the road department. I would request that you advise the project team to return to the previous schedule.

I look forward to the problem beeing resolved.

Yours faithfully,
Stanislav.
