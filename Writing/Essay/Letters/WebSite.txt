Hi Alex,
    I'm writing to say that I just remembered your question about the IELTS. While my preparation 
I've found the ielts-lizi.com.
    I was training for a test five month and having some problems with tricks. 
I was surfing the Internet with some useful info about them and found out Lizzi's web-site.
    There are many suitable materials and advice for anyone who wants to get a high mark. You find  
videos and posts for each part of the exam. The tutor explains every tricky feature of it.
    The last week before the test, I spent all my free time there, reading examples of writing tasks. For me, it is a horrible part, 
I hope you understand. Also, explanations for the listening part are very useful for avoiding misleading words and be ready for
different question types.
    If you had questions, I'd glad to help you. 
    Keep in touch, Stas.
