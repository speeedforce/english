    Hi Alex, I'm glad that you decide to stay at my home. We will have enough time 
for a chat and have a fun after my business trip.
    I'm sorry to say that I couldn't meet you when you arrive. That's why you need
to take the keys to my parents. They live in the center and you can take bus number 9. 
You knew my father and he will met you at the bus-station.
Also, take care of my cat. I bought food for them and placed it in the kitchen in the cupboard. 
You can take and buy any food that you will find, I hope there is enough. But
I will thankful if you don't eat in the living room. Wi-Fi password is 84212 and you can use playstation
for fun.
    I will return on Friday morning and I suggest meeting in "London-Tea". It's small
coffee, but there is the best coffee in London. Feel like home.
    See you on Friday,
    Looking forward, Stas.
