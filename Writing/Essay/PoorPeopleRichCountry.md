Impoverished is one of the biggest problems in our days and even for successful countries is being 
a complicated problem. Some people believe that we have a wrong base of sharing resources between people.
On the contrary, others think it is a problem only of attitude poor people to hard work, their laziness and style of life.
As for me, both ideas make sense and I partly sharing each of them.

If we look at the base of our economy, we will easily understand why we have so huge separation between a wealthy people 
and poor. As for me, capitalism isn't about justice or equality, it's about of money and ways for rich them.  
As specially, it relates to the rich countries which manage of world economic. In these countries you have fantastic opportunities
to be a successfull, make you busines, but at the same time, it takes a lot efforts and money.
The life in these countries are expensive and event though all features sometimes can't figure out with it. We know the fact, that
medicine in the USA is an extortionate and even a worker person doesn't have access to all options.

The contrary idea is that poor people who have a social benefits don't want to change anything and they accept living when others
pay for theirs bill. It entail to social problem and conflicts. It is understandable, because it's unjustice to someone who works
days and nights, pay the same bills on their own, when another get money from the empty. So, that's why I support the idea for 
making the options and opportunity to the poor people than just give them money. I think that free education and medicine for 
someone who can't pay are the chance to change their life to better. Poor isn't bad person or lazines, it is a temporary state of life
and society can manage it. You can look to the top of the Forbs and a lot of millioners were born in poor environment.

In conclusion, first of I need to say that I want to see the whole wolrd without this problem, not only the wealth countries. However,
they can make a pattern to others for solving this issue. They have money and ability to create and maintain social programs for poor people.
Above all of these, the people also need understand that hard work and desire to change their life are also important. 
For changing your life, you don't need to sit and way someone from outside, just do it.
