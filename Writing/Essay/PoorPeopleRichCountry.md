Impoverished is one of the biggest problems in our days and even for successful countries is being 
a complicated problem. Some people believe that we have a wrong base of sharing resources between people.
Others think it is a problem only of attitude poor people to hard work, their laziness and style of life.
As for me, both ideas make sense and I partly sharing each of them.

If we look at the base of our economy, we will easily understand why we have so huge separation between a wealthy people 
and poor. As for me, capitalism isn't about justice or equality, it's about of money and ways for rich them.  
Especially, it relates to the rich countries which manage the world economy. On the one hand, you have fantastic opportunities
to be successful, make business, but on the other hand it takes a lot of effort and there life is expensive.
We know the fact, that medicine in the USA is extortionate and even a working person doesn't have access to all options.

On the contrary, the idea is that poor people, who have social benefits, don't want to change anything and they accept life when others
pay for their bill. It entails social problems and conflicts. So, that's why I support the idea for 
making the options and opportunity to the poor people instead of just giving them money. I think that free education and medicine for 
someone who can't pay is the chance to change their life to better.

In conclusion, first of all I need to say that I want to see the whole world without this problem, not only for wealth countries. However,
they can make a pattern to others for solving this. They have money and ability to create and maintain the social programs for poor people.
Also, we need two-way communication. Someone who cheats should understand that hard work and desire to change their lives are also important. 
For changing your life, you don't need to sit and way someone from outside, just do it.
