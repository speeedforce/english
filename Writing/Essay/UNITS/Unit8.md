## Task 2.1
Although many countries are becoming richer, these soceities still have members who are poor and struggle each 
day for survive.
Why do you think this happens and what can wealthy societies do to help their poorer citizens.

### Answer:

I certainly agree with the fact that we have more than enough poor people in the world. Even rich and successful countries like the USA, Germany, GB have a problem with social protection for the impoverished people. However, not only society can be the reason of so global tendency. I strongly believe there are two roots of this problem: the world model of life and personal irresponsibility.

## Task 2.2

Except for the medician point of this question, we need to explore the social problem. Each parent wants the best for their child, even though don't care about others. For example, your child goes to school
and you discovered that some of the other children are sick. In this case, you will ask for protection for your kid. But, how often people responsible on their side? Does each parent have a medical education and able to discover disease at the beginning? So, I strongly believe that vaccinations are socially responsible too.
