Young people today are better qualified than they were in the past.
Some people argue that this is because competition for jobs is greater than it used to be.
Others say that people continue their education because the opportunities exist for them to do so.

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

1) Main point: In short is "TRUE", but in the past people had less information, but
had deepper knowledge of the base,in the contrary today people have a surface knowledge about fundamental,
but have more practices.

1.1) The young people change the world in each time period. It doesn't matter, one hundread years ago or 
nowadays. 

1.2) In the past, the life rithm was a little bit slower and calm. Lake of information the reason for repeating
the same books and knowledge. Hence, it has leaded to quigh quality of understandable subject or area.


The world life is changing an every year. The rythm is becoming hectic and young people are the first who react to it.
Debating between "old-school" and modern is the circeling thing in the world history. Some of old-fashion supporters
attract attention to the poor quality of the fundamental things in knowledge. Modern people insist on the practices and new ways 
of education. 

Firstly, every person will be agree that the modern life with new technologies, such as Internet,
is more rushing than a 50 years before. For example, in the past for studying something had taken more time, because 
the resources was limitted. The people continue to repeat and keep concentration on the base things.
With the Interent you don't have such problem. Secondly, the choice of job type was a life-question. Person spend 
all their life for becoming the high proffesional in one are.

In the modern life, with technologies a lot of the typical job are disapeared very quickly. It leads, to learning more 
practicing skills than something base or fundamental. I suppose in the nearest future, person will change at least two 
type of job during whole life. This pace is the reason why young people need to understand and study a lot of new 
infomation, change their job desires and adapt to current world. This ability looks like super-skill for some of them.

In conclusion, I wanted to emphasize, that the question "better or not" isn't accepted for me. I would like to think, that 
all generations are different. I mean that they are the best for their time, because we continue observing that world are
developing and changing. For my side, the root of these things is young people.
