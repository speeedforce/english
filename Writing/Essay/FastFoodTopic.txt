Fast food is having a terrible effect on the health of the nation. As such, it should be banned.
Do you agree?

1) Problem - yes, but it is a question of personal freedom to choose.
    It is not propriate ways to solve problem, because:
    1.1) The root of this in another
    1.2) Restriction is breaking basic human rights

2) Solutions: 
    2.1) Sport activities
    2.2) Sharing information about healthy food 
    

Obviosely, junk food has many negative effects on generation health, such as obisity, heart deases and others unpleasants.
While this fact, I do not agree that restriction is a right way for solving this problem.

Firstly, banned something is a breaking human rights to choose what they what. Each person in this world has 
ability to choose what food eat, what cloth wear and what movies whatch. Secondly, restrictions would be work only
for some categories of people, who can't take care of themselves and stop their consumtion of unhealthy food, when others will lose
posibility to make their own way. Thirdly, in my opinion, people have more better solution for increasing health level in next generation,
without any tiranic methods.

Solutions should be work in a long term perspective, for example, develop positive attitude and involve community to sport. 
Implementation new sport programs for kids can lead them to healthy life style, influence on their preferences. Moreover, 
parents which children visiting sport sections usually joining to them. Another way is sharing knowledges about health food
and cut taxes for farmers who grow it. People with short income select street food only because it is cheaper than health.
Also, good way is sharing information in society how dangerous fry food can be, how offen eating can be harmful for person.

In conclusion, banning something, not matter what is it, is easier way, but is a shortcoming and a old-fashion point of view. 
It looks like, curing symptoms, but not the reason. I can't support this and prefer to find better answers, which will work 
in long distance, for many next generation.
