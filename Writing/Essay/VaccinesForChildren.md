Many childhood diseases can now be prevented through the use of vaccines.

Should parents be made by law to imminise their children against common disease 
or should individuals have right to choose not immunise their children?

Ideas:

    Generall: "Yes, should"
    1) Prevented diseases better than cure them
       1.1) You don't need worried about recovering or something else, take presure at this time.
       1.2) Cheaper. Medecine is very expensive etc
    2) Resposible of socials 
       1) Responsible front of other peoples/childs etc


The question about vaccination is very complicated for a lot of people. It is a part
of understanding, what is an exactly democracy and ability to make a free choice.  
That's why we know cases that several people speculate on vaccination for children and themselves. 
However, I believe that this issue we should avoid abstract or phylosophical meaning and 
take care of our health. That's why I support the laws rules for the protection all child in the world.

First of all, the majority of doctors alsways emphasise that the better cure is a pretened the illnes.
A lot of people have heard about the rules for improving health, like take sports, sleep enough, eat health 
food etc. The vaccine is the addition to all of these. All parents want the best for their child. 
Avoiding illneses is a fantastic opportunities in nowadays. It ralates to the main parrents idea of protection.
Also, we know that the medecine is very expensive in our days. So, vaccination can be a way for saving money
and use them for better purpose than treatment.

We shouldn't forget about sociaty. Sometimes we're selfish, but we don't like it when someone
selfish to us. You're child communicate with others and you want to be essure that his or her friends are good and health.
You want be sure that the kindergardent will be safty for him. For Ukraine, a lot of common desiase like cold or fule 
childre are picking up there. Hence, the vaccination can fix it, make these place safety. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that people should use vaccine for protection their child. We know a lot of consipacy theories
about this proccess, but the main problem of conspiracy you can never prove it. Can we manage of these or proving these people?
I don't think so, but involding this proccess to the law can save and protect a lot of another families and childreen. 
It the main reason for that.
