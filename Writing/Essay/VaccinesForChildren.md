Many childhood diseases can now be prevented through the use of vaccines.

Should parents be made by law to imminise their children against common disease 
or should individuals have right to choose not immunise their children?

Ideas:

    Generall: "Yes, should"
    1) Prevented diseases better than cure them
       1.1) You don't need worried about recovering or something else, take presure at this time.
       1.2) Cheaper. Medecine is very expensive etc
    2) Resposible of socials 
       1) Responsible front of other peoples/childs etc


The question about vaccination is very complicated for a lot of people. It is a part
of understanding, what is an exactly democracy and ability to make a free choice.  
That's why we know cases that several people speculate on vaccination for children and themselves. 
However, I believe that this issue we should avoid abstract or philosophical meaning and 
take care of our health. That's why I support the law's rules for the protection all children in the world.

First of all, the majority of doctors always emphasise that the better cure is a pretend the illness.
A lot of people have heard about the rules for improving health, like take sports, sleep enough, eat healthy
food, etc. The vaccine is an addition to all of these. All parents want the best for their kids. 
Avoiding illnesses is a fantastic opportunity nowadays. It relates to the main of parents idea of protection.
Also, we know medicine is very expensive in our days. So, vaccination can be a way of saving money
and use them for a better purposes than treatment.

We shouldn't forget about society. Sometimes we're selfish, but we don't like it when someone
selfish to us. Your child communicates with others and you want to be confident that his or her friends are nice and healthy.
You want be sure that the kindergarten will be safe for him. In Ukraine, a lot of common diseases like cold or fever 
children are picking up there. Hence, the vaccination can fix it, make these places safer. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that people should use vaccines to protect their children. We know a lot of conspiracy theories
about this process, but the main problem of the conspiracy you can never prove it. Can we manage this? Prove to these people?
I don't think so, but involving this proccess to the law can save and protect a lot of another families and childreen. 
It the main reason for that.
