Some people say young people should be completely free to choose their 
future job but others think young people must be more realistic in their choice.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

1. Young people should evaluate their abilities and environment.
2. Opportunity to make free choice is a value and we should protect it.
Follow your dream vs apply real life situation.

It is considered by some that choosing future job only by dreams or imagination, without
understanding adult life can be misleading and disapointment for young people, but others
think that choice should be followed by truly desires and no matter of consequences.
In my opinion, I think that young people need to clearly understand their strengths and weekneses,
additionally environment situation and after deep research make an optimal solution.

On the one hand, when you are young you want to follow your dream. It makes you life colorfull and
gives you energy for a hard work and a education. In other words, we know that following idea of something
which special for us and working just for enjoing inspire us. Additionally, we read a lot of stories
and books about person who reach successful doing a job which their truly love. But, often, these stories
have missed a failure and some key situation or context which incluence on the result.

On the other hand, solving adult problems is a complicated process and takes a lot of your effort. Young people
need accepted that they have to earn money, handle new responsibilities and sometimes their desires will not 
match with a real world. Also, they need revise their skills and abiliteis to doing some job. It is important 
for growing procces, sincerely understand who you are and what you can do the best. However, it doesn't mean
that you should completely ignore your wishes.

In conclusin, selecting a propriate job is either in what you want and what you able to do by life context. 
Young people should honestly understand financial situation, real abilities and their desire for a job in order
to be sure of success.
