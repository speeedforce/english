Many people decide on a career path early in their lives and keep to it. This, they argue, leads to a 
more satisfying working life.

To what extent do you agree with this view?

What other things can people do to try and have a satisfying working life?

1) Ideas:
    

    Main:
        1) This point make sense, because people have a lot of expirience in the end.
            1.1) You are a proffesional and valuable specialist (salary, famous)
            1.2) You just focus on one sphere

        2) Athmosphere and balance
           2.1) Teamates 
           2.2) Statisticly people who can't get overtime, more happier and more love their work than other


Some people believe that if you choose a profession at the begging of your life and then follow it, you will 
a happy person. I support this idea because the decision of a job way is really important and influences your life.
If you choose a suitable type of job, you would never regret it and be successful.

When people young, sometimes, they don't know what exactly they want to do. It's a typical situation, but the people who
get the job at the start of their life would have more advantages before others. First of all, this person would have more
experience. The experience gives you confidence in your ability to solve problems and issues. Hence, you feel a feedback from the job, reach 
some awards, you can control your stress. On the one hand, being long term in one sphere can hurt your ability to learn or research something new, 
on the other hand, you have had a focus on one domain, you would have a deep understanding of problems.

Of course, enjoying of the job doesn't depend only on a person by itself. People around are an extremely important part. I'm sure, nobody doesn't like
toxic coo-workers or teams. IT is hard to carry on work. A peaceful atmosphere inside a team is key for successful companies. Another significant thing is trying 
to save a balance between your professional and personal life. Life out of work is directly impacts on our ability to go through 
different work challenges. Statistically, people happier in countries, where society doesn't accept overworking.

To conclude, many things affect our life. The earlier career choice can help you to extremely build your career and easier at young ages.
However, it isn't the one factor. Colleges, work-life balance is also important for your emotional health. The key to enjoyable works, as for me,
is to do what you're really want to do. Doesn't matter social status, money, or something else.
