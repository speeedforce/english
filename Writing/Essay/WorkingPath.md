Many people decide on a career path early in their lives and keep to it. This, they argue, leads to a 
more satisfying working life.

To what extent do you agree with this view?

What other things can people do to try and have a satisfying working life?

1) Ideas:
    

    Main:
        1) This point make sense, because people have a lot of expirience in the end.
            1.1) You are a proffesional and valuable specialist (salary, famous)
            1.2) You just focus on one sphere

        2) Athmosphere and balance
           2.1) Teamates 
           2.2) Statisticly people who can't get overtime, more happier and more love their work than other


Some people believe that if you choose a profession at the begging of your life and then follow it, you will 
a happy person. I support this idea, because the decision of a job way is really important and influence on your life.
If you choose a suitable type of job, you would never regret it and be successful.

When people young, sometimes, they don't know what exactly they want to do. It's a typical situation, but the people who
get the job in the start of their life would have more advantages before others. First of all, this person would have more
expirience. The expirience give you a confidence in your ability to solve problems and issues. Hence, you would feel a feedback from job, reach 
some awards, you can figure your stress. On the one hand, being long term in a one sphere can hurt your ability to learn or research something new, 
on the other hand, you have had a focus on one domain, you would have a deep understanding of problems.

Of course, enjoing of job doesn't depend only of person by itself. People around us is an extreamly important part. I'm sure, nobody doesn't like
a toxic coo-workers or teams. There is hardly to carry on work. Peacefull atmosphere inside a team is a key of succesfull companies. Another significant
thing is a trying to save balance between your proffesion life and social. Life out of work is directly impact on our ability to go through 
different work challanges. Statisically, people more happier in counries, where sociaty doesn't accept overworking.

To conclude, many things have effected on our life. The earlier career choice can help you to extreamly build your career and easier in young ages.
However, it isn't the one factor. Colleges, work-life balance are also important for you emotional health. The key of engoyable works, as for me,
it is do what you're really want to do. Doesn't matter social status, money or something else.
