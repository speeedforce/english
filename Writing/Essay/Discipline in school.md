Discipline is an ever increasing problem in modern schools. 
Some people think that discipline should be the responsibility of teachers,
while others think that this is the role of parents.
Discuss both sides and give your opinion.

Main idea: It is the two-way connection between parents and teachers.

Why teachers should be responsible of descipline? :
    1) They have a professional knowledge of kids mentals ability and behaviour
    2) They can influence on child by marks and scores, which are important for kid.

Why parents shoulb be responsible?
    1) Take care of child this is main responsible of parent
    2) Parents can influence by their self-behavior.

    The kids of last decade are really different than their parents. 
The world are changing and we have to discuss a new challanges of growing process.
The majority of parents think that their child spend more time in school in comparething with them.
To their mind, teaching of human being is a task for a teacher. Contrary, teachers believe that parents have 
more ability to infuence on their child. It is their job to explaine about people relationship, mental skills and other things.
    Teaching is a hard proces, especialy for a modern child. Teenagers have a lot of entertaiment stuff and they're
definetely interesting than learning subjects. They are playing videogames and chats in a social medias on the lessons.
Teacher waste of time, arguing with disobeing studends. These interaptions hurt the education process. Teachers emphasise that their job is teach subject, but not a behavior in sociaty. To their point, parents have to explaine their child sociaty norms, teach them of responsibilities or even dueties. In addition, children have more strict connection with mom and dad, several of them said. They offen have mirrored home state to the school.
    However, parents are really disagree with it. Sometimes, they complaine that child doesn't listen them. The young parents even 
have admited that they haven't had an enough experience to figure out. Also, they have a view, that teachers have a silver bullet like mark. To my expirence, achivements are important to youngest studends. They worry about which mark they have. But with years, a good marks have been losing their power. It became less important for teenagers for example.
    In conclusion, to my point of view, dicepline shoud be developed by both sides. That's why important a quick comunications
between parents and teachers. Each of them have their scope of responsibility and all things which relate to human being, soft skils shoud be shared between them. Working together, they could be more productive than separately.
