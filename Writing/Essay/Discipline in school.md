Discipline is an ever increasing problem in modern schools. 
Some people think that discipline should be the responsibility of teachers,
while others think that this is the role of parents.
Discuss both sides and give your opinion.

## Main idea: It is the two-way connection between parents and teachers.

### Why teachers should be responsible of descipline? :
    1) They have a professional knowledge of kids mentals ability and behaviour
    2) They can influence on child by marks and scores, which are important for kid.

### Why parents shoulb be responsible?
    1) Take care of child this is main responsible of parent
    2) Parents can influence by their self-behavior.

    The kids of the last decade are really different than their parents and even their contemporary, who born ten years ago. The world is changing and we have to discuss a new challanges of growing process. The majority of parents think that their child spends more time in school in comparison with with together them. To their mind, teaching human beings is a task for a teacher. Contrary, teachers believe that parents have  more ability to influence on their child. It is their job to explain people relationship, mental skills, and other things.
    
    Teaching is a hard process, especially for a modern child. Children have a lot of entertainment conent and they're definitely interesting than learning subjects. They are playing video games and chatting in social networks during the lessons. A teacher should interrupt a lesson and pay attention to these. It hurts the education process. Teachers emphasise that their job is teaching subjects, but not behavior in society. To their point, parents have to explain to their child society culture, teach them responsibilities and duties. In addition, they believe that children have more strict connection with mom and dad. They offen have mirrored home state to the school.
    
    However, some parents disagree with it. They are complaining that child doesn't listen to them. The young parents sometimes have been admitting that they haven't been having enough experience to solve it out. Also, they have a view, that teachers have silver bullets like marks. In my experience, achievements are important to the youngest students. They worry about which mark they have. But with years, good marks have been losing their power. It has been becoming less important for teenagers for example.
    
    In conclusion, discipline should be developed by both sides. That's why important communication between parents and teachers. Each of them has their scope of responsibility and all things which relate to soft skills should be shared between them, help each other. Working together, they could be more productive than separately.
