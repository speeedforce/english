I completely agree that everyone person


We are living in a consumption era and some people believed that our attitude to ecology is 
careless. The one of the biggest problem for their mind is a lack of responsibility to recycling. 
Population are growing and we leave vast of garbage around us.
I strongly believe that humanity should more care about our nature.

Nowadays, we spend a lot time for buying things. However, I think majority of us don't 
care what will happend with stuff when we through it out. As a result, we have a heavy problem
with tons of garbage in our landfills. We don't thinks about future and which world we will leave for our chilldren.
Our recylcing abilities are less than counter of consumption. That's why we should take this problem in our hands. 
If we properly consider our attitude to our environment, we will more responsible to our this.

Unfortunatelly, some people believe that recycling isn't a decision for us and a single person can't change
anything in our world. I understand this sceptisim, but the governments can ifluence on this.
They have the mechanisms for involving people to this problem, they should maintain and create 
the volunteries program, emphasise that recycling is an important. 

In conlusion, our future depends on only us. We have an opportunity for changing our wolrd and 
make it better. It's possible to influnce to the world just be yourself as an example.
