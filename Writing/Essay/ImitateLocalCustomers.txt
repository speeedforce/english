Some people think visitors to others countries should imitate local customers and behaviours. Some people disagree; they
think the host country should welcome cultural differences. Discuss the two views and give your opinion.

1) The main idea about respect to each other between people

1.1) When you want to travel to some country will be good to find some information about it. It will help to avoid
some conflicts. But it doesn't mean that you need to be like local.
1.2) In my experience, if you respect and polite to national mentality you will welcome in may countries in the world.


2.1) Friendly attitude shouldn't be only for tourists or guests

The world is changing and modern transport types made traveling easier than in previous ages.
For traveller is important to know how should they interact in a foreigh environement.
Some people believe that you need to behave as local for good attitude to you from their side. 
Other ephasize that countries should be interesting in tourists and guests. 
As for me the key of succesful trip is respect each other.

First of all, I'm sure that you don't need to play home-born role. It will looks weird, moreover, in some cases it can 
be understand as mocking. When you are going to visit some country, will be wiser to google some infomations and 
national traditions. This knowledge will help you to communicate with locals and avoid not propriete actions there.
For example, in some countries religions is a one of the important thing in their cultures and wroing attitude to it 
can cost even your life. 

However, if we talk about host countries we need understand that friendly attitude shouldn't be only for tourists or guests.
Respecting each other, doesn't matter local your or guest show the hight social level in country. 
It shows that this country are open to wolrd. Of course, person who don't know language and cultrural specific needs more 
patient and time for adaptation. 

In conclusion, travelling is a wonderful ability in nowadays. We can research and interesting in own way and become 
more opening to world. It develops our mental ability to understand and welcome diversity between us. Hence, better
understanding each other lead to solving and avoiding conflicts.
