Social behaviour and manners have changed a great deal in the last 20 years. Discuss.


Main points:
1) Tech has changed our attitude to a lot of things: people, stuff etc
Some new activities have become matter for us, for instance: followers, likes on your posts,
comments. 

2) However, people still worried about some base feelings, love, freedom, dignity, honest.
Refer to the past and lead to nowadays. The environment and some attitudes have been
rethough.

Human relationship have been extremely changed by the last two decades. In my opinion,
it is definetely true, with technological development we have got a new 
opportunities to simplify our connections, as for example using social-networks,
which are influence on our conduct.

Social-networks have increase communication effect between people. They have bring new senses, for example, 
number followers or comments or likes, desires to share your life with whole world. 
Hence, it relates on our imagination of this world and how we behave and think. We can't underestimate the tech
influence on people actions. Moreover, we know facts that some people have mental problems which are mirroring on 
their behaviour.

Despite on new ways, many people follow in their desicions by heart feelings. Some fundamental concepts, like
a freedom, dignity, love still matter in our life. Like in the past, we find something special in abstract. We 
continue to combat with dishonesty and rudeness, for instanse support save-climate programs or protect human rights.
Of course, technically expressing soul things was changed, but the main point is they don't have a time measures. 

In conclusion, it is completely understandable that sociaty interaction has been changed since the begining, as an evolution process.
People are learning how manage with new things, but in my mind, our deep feelings and instincts have more impact on our life.
