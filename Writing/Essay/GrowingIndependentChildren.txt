Children who grow up in families which are short of money are better prepared with the problems of adult life than children
who are brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree?


    Nowadays a gap between rich and poor people is becoming wider. That is why, some people think that children who is growing
in an affluent families sometimes can't able to solve afult problem. To their mind, their growing condition is just relaxing and
following the desires, without any responsibilities. Contrary to it, children in poor families have to take care of themselves
and even support their parrents.Also, form the young ages they have a desire to change situation. Built better future for their children. 
This is a strong motivation to self-eductation and working hard.
    Child in poor families has to work sometimes earlier than their contemporaries in rich family. Hence, they
need to earn money for themselves and their family members. That is why their attitude to hard work, 
to money has been changing. 
    Of course, childrens who have all things what they want in their childhood, will observe the life on different angle. But it 
doesn't mean that they can't grow independent and self-respectable person. As for me, in this situation very important is parents
example. The best eductaion which you can give to your child is your example. If you show how you make and solve issues, they
will follow your behavior. Additionally, these children can have a good education in school and university. 
Education in concurent environment, with high quality specialist is a amazing opportunity to learn not only subjects, 
but also develop personal skills.
    In conclusion, I partly agree that the children who is growing up in impoverished have more real life skills than others.
They know the cost of money, time and have respect to the hard work. Being spoiled much easier in a wealthy failly, it is a 
reason of inability to solve problem in adult life for these children. Finally, I think that education important much more than
financial ability.
