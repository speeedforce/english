    We have a rule, from the past, that cities are richer and safety than villages. This tendency, particularly, keeps in our days.

    When we imagine a modern city we have a picture of success and abundance. The world economy, techs, and other
spheres are concentrated there. That's why people desire to move to a big city and make their life better.
Nowadays, cities give you chances to find yourself in all domains. Also, at the same time, a lack of jobs
and underclass situation in the small towns or villages has increased the moving process from there. 
On the one hand, it's a reason for overpopulation in cities, but on the other hand, it builds a huge social network. 
Social connections are very important for majority of people. Hence, it's easier to find a like-minded person. 
    Despite developing yourself and building a career, the absolutely amazing part of living in the city is entertainment.
Each person can find something for his tasty. A lot of events like parties, concerts, fests , conferences, sports events are an
irreplaceable piece of the city's life. In my experience, the really big cities never sleep and they live 24/7.

    In conclusion, I think the popularity of the city's life is a result globalization process. During a long time, the cities are growing
rapidly and becoming attractive to people who want to make their life better. The modern city has many problems and some of them
are complicated, but in spite of this fact, people continue to find a better life there.
